# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a web-based user interface for the Scalable Web Scraping API. The UI will provide a modern, intuitive dashboard that allows users to manage scraping jobs, monitor their status, and view results without needing to interact directly with the REST API endpoints. The application will be built using React + Vite to provide a fast, responsive user experience for managing web scraping operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create new scraping jobs through a web interface, so that I can easily initiate web scraping operations without using API calls directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the job creation form THEN the system SHALL display input fields for URL, selectors, and scraping configuration options
2. WHEN I submit a valid scraping job request THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/scrape` endpoint and display the job ID
3. WHEN I submit an invalid form THEN the system SHALL display validation errors and prevent submission
4. WHEN the API returns an error THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view a list of all my scraping jobs with their current status, so that I can track the progress of my scraping operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the jobs dashboard THEN the system SHALL display a list of all scraping jobs with their status, creation time, and job ID
2. WHEN a job status changes THEN the system SHALL automatically update the display without requiring a page refresh
3. WHEN I click on a job entry THEN the system SHALL navigate to the detailed job view
4. WHEN there are no jobs THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about a specific scraping job, so that I can monitor its progress and access the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a job detail page THEN the system SHALL display job status, creation time, completion time, and configuration details
2. WHEN a job is completed THEN the system SHALL display a link or button to view the scraped results
3. WHEN a job is in progress THEN the system SHALL show real-time status updates
4. WHEN a job has failed THEN the system SHALL display error information and failure reasons

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and export scraped data results, so that I can use the extracted information for my purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access completed job results THEN the system SHALL display the scraped data in a readable format (table, JSON, etc.)
2. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL provide options to export data in different formats (JSON, CSV)
3. WHEN results are large THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtual scrolling for performance
4. WHEN there are no results THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message explaining why

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor the health and status of the scraping API, so that I can ensure the system is operational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display API health status using the `/health` endpoint
2. WHEN the API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a clear warning message and disable job creation
3. WHEN the API connection is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically update the health status
4. WHEN there are API connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL provide helpful troubleshooting information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive interface, so that I can efficiently manage scraping operations from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
2. WHEN I navigate through the application THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation and breadcrumbs
3. WHEN I perform actions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback through loading states and success/error messages
4. WHEN I use the application THEN the system SHALL follow modern UI/UX best practices for accessibility and usability
